## The Search

As a team we brought individual ideas and sources of datasets. We finalized on datasets from Chicago Data Portal on food inspections on establishments in Chicago. This source was reliable and had a variety of options. We finalized on two datasets one downloaded as csv and another using thier API call to get output as json. </p>
